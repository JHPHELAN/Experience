# Experience
Learn from my mistakes and successes as I stumble through projects.
This is a stream of activity log as I attempt each project (primarily the JPL Open Source Rover) and sub-projects (such as cameras, LIDAR, etc)
CAUTION: don't blindly follow my trail as there are more dead ends than successes.  Read on to see the result of a path before you pursue!
